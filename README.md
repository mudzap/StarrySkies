# StarrySkies
By: Iván Peña, Universidad Anáhuac

Simple python script to generate random crops at a set resolution from a set of bigger images. Made for observatory and telescope photos.
By pulling random cropped images and downscaling these I can lazily make wallpapers for myself. AFAIK It doesn't handle non-integer downscaling factors because of personal preference, you're free to change that.

Requires: NumPy, glob, argparse, Pillow

A x64 Python install is recommended because of high memory requirements with large images.

Original images pulled from: https://www.spacetelescope.org/

Have fun. Any questions just do: StarrySkies.py -h.
